#### Extremely basic message board app for The Odin Project

It allows users to read and write messages. It uses no database; messages are stored in-memory, so when the instance spins down, the messages are lost.

Please note that the [live deployment](https://mini-message-board-q5dd.onrender.com/) may take up to a minute to spin back up.

This is my first Express app, also marking my first use of the EJS templating language.
